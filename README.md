MouseMover
==========
A simple Windows application that simulates mouse movement to prevent the screensaver or screen lock from activating. Great for making presentations or working on a computer where you have limited access to modify the screensaver or screen lock settings. Obviously, you shouldn't use this on a system where security is important.
